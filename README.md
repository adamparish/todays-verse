## Synopsis

This is a simple HTTP Google Assistant webhook listner. This script will listen for input from the Today's Verse Google Action, retrieve Today's Verse using the ESV Bible Web Service API, and return the text result back to Today's Verse on Google Action.

## Motivation

I started this project as I started working with the Google Assistant API.AI. My goal is to make a more robust application for Google Assistant, but I had previous experience working with the ESV Bible Web Service API. Because the API is old, it's not very sophisticated and super easy to test.

## Installation

I'll be running this project on the Google App Engine. Let's see how hard that is.
